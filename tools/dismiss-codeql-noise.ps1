.SYNOPSIS
  Bulk-dismiss CodeQL alerts that are intentional patterns or false positives.

.DESCRIPTION
  Walks all open CodeQL alerts in the repo and dismisses each one based on
  its rule ID, with a category-specific reason and comment. Idempotent —
  re-running dismisses any new alerts in these same categories without
  affecting alerts in other (potentially actionable) categories.

  The intent is: keep the Security tab high-signal. Real findings get fixed
  in code (see commits referencing CodeQL findings); intentional patterns
  and informational notes get dismissed here once with a documented reason.

  To dismiss a new category, add an entry to $Categories. To stop dismissing
  one, remove its entry — the script will stop touching alerts of that rule
  ID, leaving any open ones alone.

.PARAMETER Repo
  GitHub repo in owner/name form. Defaults to gamertune/gamertuneapp.

.PARAMETER DryRun
  Print what would be dismissed without calling the API.

.NOTES
  Requires the gh CLI authenticated with repo write access (specifically the
  security_events: write permission, which the default token has for repo
  admins).

  Dismissed alerts can be re-opened via the GitHub Security tab or the API
  if a category later turns out to need fixing.
