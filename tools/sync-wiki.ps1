.SYNOPSIS
  Push the markdown files in docs/wiki/ to the GitHub wiki repo.

.DESCRIPTION
  Wikis on GitHub are a separate Git repo at <repo>.wiki.git, but it
  doesn't exist until you create at least one page in the web UI.
  This script clones that repo, copies docs/wiki/*.md into it, commits,
  and pushes — making docs/wiki/ the source of truth and the wiki a
  rendered mirror.

.NOTES
  First-time setup:
    1. Go to https://github.com/gamertune/gamertuneapp/wiki
    2. Click "Create the first page" — any content is fine; this script
       overwrites it.
    3. Run this script.
