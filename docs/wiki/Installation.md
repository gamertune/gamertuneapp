# Installation

## Quick install

1. Grab the latest **`GamerTune-Setup-x.y.z.exe`** from the [Releases page](https://github.com/gamertune/gamertuneapp/releases/latest).
2. Run it. Windows SmartScreen will warn that the installer is unsigned — click **More info** → **Run anyway**. Code signing via the [SignPath Foundation](https://signpath.org/) is on the roadmap.
3. Per-user install — no admin needed, lands at `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\GamerTune`.
4. The app launches and opens its settings window the first time:

   ![Settings window — General tab](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gamertune/gamertuneapp/main/docs/screenshots/settings-general.png)

   Click through the tabs to set per-display, global gaming, privacy, debloat, network, services, and AI preferences. Changes are staged as you toggle them — **Save & close** persists your choices and **Apply** writes them immediately and re-checks the system. For a fast start, the **General** tab has three one-click presets (Apply recommended / Apply extreme / Reset all to defaults).

A portable single-file `GamerTune.exe` is also attached to each release if you don't want the installer. Drop it anywhere and run it.

## Auto-update

After v0.1.14, every running copy auto-checks for new releases on startup and offers a one-click in-place upgrade. The downloader writes to `%TEMP%`, then runs the installer in upgrade mode. If you decline, the prompt is suppressed for that version (skip-this-version semantics).

You can also trigger a check manually from **Settings → General → Check now**.

## Uninstall

Standard Windows: **Settings → Apps → Installed apps → GamerTune → Uninstall**, or `appwiz.cpl`.

The uninstaller:
- Stops any running `GamerTune.exe` process
- Removes the install folder
- Removes the `HKCU\...\Run\GamerTune` autostart entry
- Cleans `%APPDATA%\GamerTune\` (config + logs)

It does **not** touch the registry-backed Windows settings GamerTune had been monitoring — those stay at whatever value was last applied.

## Compatibility

- **Windows 11** (any version). Windows 10 support is on the roadmap.
- **x64** only.
- Requires .NET 8 — the installer ships a self-contained build, so no separate runtime install needed.
