# Settings & tabs guide

This page explains **every tab** in the GamerTune Settings window and **what each setting does and means**. For the deep per-setting reference — why the recommendation is what it is, a plain-English **pro/con of each choice**, per-scenario recommendations, risks, and copy-pasteable **verify / apply / reverse** PowerShell commands — see [SETTINGS-REFERENCE.md](https://github.com/gamertune/gamertuneapp/blob/main/docs/SETTINGS-REFERENCE.md), which is generated from the source catalog.

## The three controls on every monitored setting

Almost every setting exposes the same three controls, so they're worth understanding once:

| Control | What it means |
|---|---|
| **Monitor** | When checked, GamerTune watches this setting and reports when it has *drifted* away from your chosen value. Display settings (HDR, refresh rate, resolution, DRR) are re-checked on every poll (default every 30 s) because Windows changes them mid-session; the set-and-forget registry/policy/service settings are re-checked at startup, when you resume from sleep, unlock the PC, or change your display, plus a slow 10-minute backstop — so the app isn't constantly polling dozens of settings that only move across a reboot. Unchecked = ignored entirely. |
| **Want** (the desired value) | The value you want this setting to hold — shown as **Enabled / Disabled** for intuitive settings or **Gaming / Default** where the registry meaning is inverted (so "Gaming" always means the gaming-optimized state, even when that writes a `0` under the hood). |
| **Auto-apply silently** | When checked, GamerTune re-applies your desired value automatically the moment it detects drift — no prompt. Unchecked = it only notifies you, and you apply with a click. |

Other conventions:

- **Current** / **Default** / **Recommended** labels under each setting show the live system value, the Windows default, and GamerTune's suggested choice. The green **Recommended** value is shown in that row's own wording — **Enabled/Disabled**, **Gaming/Default**, **On/Off**, or a service's **Default/Manual/Disabled** — so it always matches the actual **Want** options. It's tuned for the typical desktop gamer: clear performance wins are recommended, security toggles (Memory Integrity / VBS) are recommended to stay **on**, and genuinely contested tweaks (Nagle, NIC power) are recommended to stay at the Windows default. For the core gaming settings the recommendation is exactly what the one-click setup applies; Privacy and Debloat recommendations are shown for guidance but stay opt-in. Settings without a documented recommendation simply omit the label.
- A yellow **reboot required** badge means the change only takes full effect after a restart.
- **Learn more** expanders carry the same per-setting explanation as the reference doc: why the value is recommended, a **pro/con of each choice** (written for someone who's never heard of the setting), per-scenario picks, risks, and a **Command line (PowerShell)** block to check the current value, apply the gaming-optimized value, and reverse it back to the Windows default.
- Changes are **staged**: toggling preferences doesn't write to Windows until you click **Apply** (or **Save & close**). Everything is reversible, and every applied change is recorded in [`changes.log`](Logging).
- **HKCU** (per-user) settings apply directly; **HKLM** (machine-wide) settings prompt once for **UAC** elevation. Multi-value changes batch into a single prompt.

## General

App preferences and the one-click setup — not a monitored-setting tab.

- **One-click setup** — three whole-config presets. Each only *stages* changes (review them per-tab, then **Apply** / **Save & close** to commit, or **Cancel** to discard) and each is idempotent, so re-running after an update only picks up the new deltas. None of them touch the **power plan** — that's isolated as a one-time, user-initiated setup on the **CPU / Power** tab:
  - **Apply recommended** — GamerTune's safe gaming preset: sets each covered setting's **Want**, turns **Monitor** on, opts into **Auto-apply**. Keeps Memory Integrity / VBS **on** (security) and leaves Privacy / Debloat / the contested network tweaks for you to choose. Skips the irreversible UWP AI-app removals.
  - **Apply extreme** — everything that could even *remotely* help gaming, on: **every** toggle at its most-aggressive value — including Memory Integrity / VBS **off** and the contested Nagle / NIC tweaks — with **Monitor and Auto-apply turned on for every setting**. Disabling Memory Integrity / VBS breaks Valorant (Vanguard) and weakens malware protection, and several changes need a reboot — it asks for confirmation first.
  - **Reset all to defaults** — the inverse: stages every setting back to its **Windows default** and turns **Monitor + Auto-apply off**. Applying then restores Windows' shipped behavior (which re-enables features you may have turned off, like Copilot, ads/suggestions, and telemetry services).
- **Launch at startup** — start GamerTune minimized to the tray when you sign in.
- **Polling interval** — how often (seconds) the fast drift check runs for the volatile display settings. Default 30 s. The set-and-forget settings don't use this — they re-check on startup / resume / unlock / display-change events plus a slow 10-minute backstop.
- **Theme** — Light / Dark / System.
- **Check for updates on startup** — looks at GitHub Releases and offers a one-click update.
- **Change log** — quick access to `changes.log`, the record of everything the app has applied.

## Global gaming

System-wide gaming tweaks (HKCU/HKLM registry). Each is a monitored toggle.

| Setting | What it does / means |
|---|---|
| **Game Mode** | Windows prioritizes the running game and suppresses background work. Safe to leave on. |
| **Game DVR background recording** | Always-on rolling game capture (Win+Alt+G). Costs CPU/GPU; gaming-recommended **off**. GamerTune also locks the machine-wide `AllowGameDVR` policy so updates can't silently re-enable capture. |
| **Hardware-accelerated GPU Scheduling (HAGS)** | Lets the GPU manage its own command queue — lower latency on supported GPUs. *(Reboot)* |
| **Memory Integrity / VBS (Core Isolation)** | Hypervisor-enforced code integrity. Disabling recovers ~5–15% gaming performance at the cost of reduced malware protection — a deliberate security trade-off. *(Reboot)* |
| **Virtualization-Based Security (full stack)** | Superset of Memory Integrity: explicit-zeros every VBS scenario (HVCI, Credential Guard, System Guard, kernel stack protection, and the community-reported 24H2 Windows Hello scenario) plus `LsaCfgFlags` and the Group Policy mirror, and deletes the upgrade re-enable metadata — the durable "actually off" switch. Detects (but never automates) UEFI locks. Registry-only, so WSL2/Docker/Hyper-V keep working. Breaks Valorant (Vanguard requires Memory Integrity). *(Reboot)* |
| **System Responsiveness** | The CPU share Windows reserves for non-multimedia tasks (default 20%). Lowering to 10% frees CPU for games. *(Reboot)* |
| **USB Selective Suspend (global)** | Stops Windows suspending idle USB devices, eliminating first-input lag on mice/keyboards/headsets. *(Reboot)* |
| **Games multimedia task profile** | Boosts the MMCSS scheduling priority of processes registered as games. |
| **Mouse "Enhance pointer precision"** | Mouse acceleration. Most gamers want this **off** for 1:1 aim. |
| **Fullscreen optimizations (global)** | Borderless-windowed compositing wrapper for fullscreen apps. Off forces true exclusive fullscreen on titles that support it. |
| **Variable Refresh Rate (DirectX)** | Exposes G-Sync/FreeSync to DirectX games that lack their own toggle. **Not** the same as Dynamic Refresh Rate (see Display). |
| **Fast Startup (hybrid boot)** | Hybrid shutdown that skips a true cold boot. Off makes every shutdown clean and fixes stale driver/USB state. *(Reboot)* |
| **Visual effects (best performance)** | Disables Windows UI animations/effects for a snappier desktop. Applies fully after sign-out. |
| **Power plan** (card) | Picks the active Windows power scheme (Balanced / High Performance / etc.). High Performance keeps CPU clocks elevated. *(See also the CPU/Power tab for a CPU-tuned custom plan.)* |

## Privacy

Telemetry/privacy toggles Windows often re-enables after feature updates — the drift-guard re-asserts your choice.

| Setting | What it does / means |
|---|---|
| **Advertising ID** | A per-user identifier apps use to profile you for ads. Privacy-recommended **off**. Per-user, no elevation. |
| **Tailored experiences** | Lets Windows use your diagnostic data to personalize tips, ads, and recommendations. Off stops the personalization. Per-user. |
| **Cross-Device Platform (CDP)** | The "Continue experiences on this device" / shared-experiences subsystem (handoff, shared clipboard, nearby-device discovery). Off via machine policy if you don't use cross-device features. |
| **Activity History / Timeline** | Collection and publishing of your activity feed. Off via machine policy (three values set together). |
| **Online (cloud) speech recognition** | When on, Windows sends your voice audio to Microsoft for processing. Off keeps recognition on-device; offline speech / Voice Access still work. Per-user. |
| **Inking & typing personalization** | Windows building (and uploading) a personal dictionary from your handwriting samples and contact names. Off stops the collection. Distinct from the Windows AI tab's typing-insights toggle (they own different registry values, so they don't conflict). Per-user. |

---

## Debloat

Switches off Windows 11's ads, nags, suggested content, and idle background features. Every toggle is **reversible** and **off + unmonitored by default** — nothing changes until you opt in. None of these touch Windows Update, security, or networking.

**Ads, nags & suggested content** (per-user, no elevation):

| Setting | What it does / means |
|---|---|
| **Suggested content & silent app installs** | The silently-installed promo apps (Candy-Crush-style installs), Start-menu app suggestions, and "tips, tricks & suggestions" cards. Off stops the installs and removes the suggestion cards. |
| **Lock screen tips, fun facts & ads** | The Windows Spotlight overlay that shows tips and ad-like captions on the lock screen. *(Suppresses the overlay; if your lock-screen background is set to Spotlight, switch it to Picture/Slideshow for a full opt-out.)* |
| **"Finish setting up your device" nag** | The post-update SCOOBE prompts to set up OneDrive / a Microsoft account / Microsoft 365. |
| **Start menu recommendations & recent files** | AI/Iris app & web suggestions plus recently opened files in the Start "Recommended" section (also a privacy win on a shared screen). |
| **File Explorer ad banners** | The OneDrive / Microsoft 365 upsell banners in the Explorer nav pane and status bar. |
| **Windows feedback request popups** | The periodic "rate your experience" dialogs. Off = Windows never asks (Feedback Hub still opens manually). |

**Background bloat** (machine-wide policy — one UAC prompt to apply):

| Setting | What it does / means |
|---|---|
| **Widgets / News and interests** | The left-edge weather button and its background MSN web feed. Off via the `Dsh` policy (stops the process) plus the taskbar-button flag. |
| **Edge startup boost & background mode** | Keeps Edge resident from boot and after you close every window. Off frees idle RAM/CPU; Edge still opens on demand and WebView2-dependent apps keep working. Set via Edge enterprise policies so it survives Edge updates. |

*Debloat toggles are intentionally **not** part of the one-click Recommended preset (same as the Privacy tab) — flip the ones you want individually.*

---

## Network

Network-latency tweaks. **Network Throttling** is a safe, well-established tweak; **Nagle** and **NIC power management** are contested — their benefit varies by hardware and can make some connections *worse*, so read each Learn more and revert if latency degrades.

| Setting | What it does / means |
|---|---|
| **Network Throttling** | Windows' MMCSS rate-limits network packets during multimedia tasks; disabling removes that pacing for steadier online-game netcode. Safe. |
| **Nagle's algorithm (TCP no-delay)** | Nagle batches small TCP packets; disabling (per active adapter) sends them immediately, which *can* lower latency. Contested — may hurt on Wi-Fi/congested links. *(Applied across all active adapters in one prompt.)* |
| **NIC power management** | Disables "Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power" so the network adapter never sleeps, avoiding wake-from-idle stalls. Higher idle power; worse on laptop battery. *(Reboot; all active adapters.)* |

## Windows services

A curated catalog of Windows services GamerTune can stop and set to **Manual** or **Disabled**, each monitored against your preference.

- **One-click presets** — "Gaming optimized" flips the safe-to-disable subset; "Default" restores them.
- **Per-service control** — Default / Manual / Disabled, with honest risk notes on each.
- Includes telemetry (`DiagTrack`), `MapsBroker`, `Fax`, `lfsvc` (Geolocation), `wisvc` (Windows Insider), Xbox services, `DoSvc` (Delivery Optimization, handled via Group Policy because Windows reverts the normal path), `iphlpsvc` (IP Helper), `RemoteAccess` / `RemoteRegistry` (drift-confirm), and more. Some (Print Spooler, Windows Search) are listed but opt-in because disabling them has real downsides.
- **Device-feature services** (opt-in, not in the preset) for hardware/features a gaming desktop usually lacks: `SEMgrSvc` (Payments/NFC), `PhoneSvc`, `stisvc` (WIA scanners/cameras), `WpcMonSvc` (Parental Controls), `AssignedAccessManagerSvc` (Kiosk Mode), `TrkWks` (Distributed Link Tracking). Disable each only if you're sure you don't use the feature.

---

## Windows AI

Policy-toggle disables for Windows/Microsoft AI features. `DesiredOn = true` keeps the Windows default; turning a row **off** writes the disable policy (reversible by deleting the same value).

- **Lockdown policies** — Copilot, Recall + AI data analysis, Click-to-Do (Snipping Tool AI), Edge Copilot/Hubs/GenAI, Notepad Rewrite + Paint AI, search-box AI suggestions + taskbar companion, Windows AI Actions (right-click rewrite/summarize), typing/input-insights data collection, and Microsoft 365 Copilot in Word/Excel/OneNote.
- **AI apps (UWP removal)** — optional one-way removal of AI UWP packages (`Microsoft.Copilot`, the AI Copilot provider, the AI Experience component, and **Microsoft 365 Copilot** — the `Microsoft.MicrosoftOfficeHub` launcher Microsoft auto-pushed to Windows 11; removing it leaves your installed Office apps untouched), with an auto-apply opt-in in case Windows re-provisions them.

Stays in the safe "policy toggle + service disable + opt-in UWP removal" lane — inspired by [zoicware/RemoveWindowsAI](https://github.com/zoicware/RemoveWindowsAI).

## Display

Per-display settings, enumerated for each active monitor. Backed by the Windows DisplayConfig (CCD) API.

| Setting | What it does / means |
|---|---|
| **HDR** | Per-display HDR on/off. Windows often turns HDR off after sleep/driver updates — monitoring catches and restores it. |
| **Dynamic Refresh Rate (DRR)** | Win11 22H2+ feature that boosts the refresh rate between a low virtual rate and the panel's physical max based on content. Shows **"Not supported on this display"** on panels/drivers that lack it. Distinct from VRR. |
| **Refresh rate** | Maximum supported, or pinned to a specific Hz. Catches Windows silently dropping the rate. |
| **Resolution** | Optionally pin a specific resolution (opt-in). |

---

## CPU / Power

CPU detection and CPU-aware power tuning.

- **Detected CPU** — the model GamerTune detected and the tuning tier it maps to.
- **Power Throttling** — disables Windows' throttling of background/idle threads for sustained performance (desktop-recommended; leave Default on laptop battery). A registry setting, not a power-scheme change.
- **Gaming power plan** — builds a CPU-tuned custom power plan (a Balanced clone with aggressive boost and the right core-parking behavior for your CPU — e.g. single-CCD X3D vs. asymmetric dual-CCD X3D). Your existing Windows plans are never modified. See [CPU-aware power plans](CPU-Power-Plans).
- **Dual-CCD routing dependencies** — for asymmetric X3D chips (e.g. 9950X3D), surfaces the BIOS/service/Game Bar prerequisites the power plan alone can't set.

---

## Recommended BIOS

Guidance only (nothing is changed): a checklist of BIOS settings worth enabling for gaming (Resizable BAR / Smart Access Memory, XMP/EXPO memory profiles, the correct CPPC mode for X3D routing, etc.). These live in firmware, outside what a user-mode app can touch.
