# GamerTune Wiki

A Windows 11 tray app that watches gaming-related display and system settings, alerts you (or auto-fixes) when they drift from your preferences, and stays out of the way during gameplay and benchmarks.

## What it looks like

Settings is split into ten tabs. See the **[Settings & tabs guide](Settings-and-tabs)** for what every tab and setting does and means.

| Tab | Covers |
|---|---|
| **General** | Theme, launch-at-startup, polling interval, update check, change log, and three one-click presets (Reset all to defaults · Apply recommended · Apply extreme) |
| **Global gaming** | Game Mode, Game DVR, HAGS, Memory Integrity/VBS, MMCSS, USB Selective Suspend, VRR, Fast Startup, Visual effects, power plan |
| **Privacy** | Advertising ID, Tailored experiences, Cross-Device Platform, Activity History, online speech recognition, inking & typing personalization |
| **Debloat** | Switches off Windows 11 ads, nags, suggested content, and idle background features — all reversible and off by default |
| **Network** | Network Throttling, Nagle's algorithm, NIC power management |
| **Windows services** | Curated catalog with one-click Gaming-optimized preset, per-service Default/Manual/Disabled |
| **Windows AI** | Policy disables for Copilot, Recall, Click-to-Do, Edge AI, Notepad/Paint AI, search AI, AI Actions, Office Copilot + optional AI UWP removal |
| **Display** | Per-display HDR, Dynamic Refresh Rate (DRR), refresh rate, resolution |
| **CPU / Power** | Detected CPU, Power Throttling, CPU-aware gaming power plan, dual-CCD routing dependencies |
| **Recommended BIOS** | Firmware checklist (guidance only) |

**How it watches:** the volatile display settings (HDR, refresh rate, resolution, DRR) are re-checked on a fast poll (default every 30 s); the ~40 set-and-forget registry/policy/service settings are re-checked at startup, on resume/unlock, on display changes, and on a slow 10-minute backstop — so the app isn't constantly polling settings that only move across a reboot. A built-in circuit breaker stops re-applying a setting that Windows keeps reverting (logged as `[CIRCUIT]`). Every setting's **Learn more** expander gives a plain-English pro/con of each choice plus a copy-pasteable PowerShell block to verify, apply the gaming value, or reverse to the Windows default.

## Getting started

- **[Installation](Installation)** — download, install, uninstall
- **[Verifying your download](Verifying-your-download)** — three independent integrity checks (VirusTotal, SHA-256, SLSA provenance) anyone can run before installing
- **[Verification](Verification)** — how to confirm GamerTune is doing what it says at runtime
- **[File locations](File-locations)** — where config, logs, and the installed binary live
- **[Logging](Logging)** — `changes.log` schema with worked examples

## Build & contribute

- **[Build from source](Build-from-source)** — local debug, local release, local installer
- **[Source file reference](Source-file-reference)** — what every `.cs` file does
- **[Architecture rationale](Architecture-rationale)** — why GamerTune looks the way it does (no kernel driver, polling, single-file publish, etc.)

## Trust & security

- **[Security](Security)** — how the build pipeline keeps the app trustworthy, and how you can verify it yourself
- **[OpenSSF Scorecard](OpenSSF-Scorecard)** — what each Scorecard check measures, what the project scores, and why
