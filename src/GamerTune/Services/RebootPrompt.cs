/// applies a reboot-requiring change funnels through here — the manual Settings
/// Apply / preset flow and the background auto-apply loop — so the prompt looks
/// and behaves the same no matter what triggered it.
///
/// <para>The window is deliberately <b>unowned</b>. The manual Apply path shows
/// this prompt and then closes the Settings window; a WPF owned window is
/// destroyed together with its owner, so an owned reboot prompt vanished the
/// instant the user clicked "Save &amp; close" after a bulk apply (the Extreme
/// preset is the worst case — it applies several reboot-required settings at
/// once). That is exactly the "applied the changes but never prompted to
/// restart" bug. Unowned, combined with the app's <c>OnExplicitShutdown</c>
/// mode, keeps the prompt alive until the user acts on it.</para>
///
/// <para>Singleton: a later batch that also needs a reboot replaces the prior
/// prompt rather than stacking a second window (same pattern as
/// <see cref="Notifier"/>). The restart action is identical regardless of which
/// settings triggered it, so replacing the descriptions loses nothing.</para>
