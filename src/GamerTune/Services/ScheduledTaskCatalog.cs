/// The Windows "Application Experience" scheduled tasks GamerTune can keep
/// disabled. These tasks drive CompatTelRunner.exe (the "Microsoft Compatibility
/// Telemetry" process), whose periodic compatibility/telemetry scans spike CPU and
/// disk — an unpredictable hitch source during gaming. Disabling them is safe
/// (Windows Update keeps working) and reversible.
///
/// All entries carry <see cref="ScheduledTaskTarget.Disabled"/> as their
/// RecommendedTarget, so the one-click Recommended preset disables the whole family.
/// The two functional tasks (StartupAppTask, PcaPatchDbTask) are included per the
/// design decision to cover the whole folder; their minor functional cost is called
/// out in each entry's description and SettingDocs.
///
/// Catalog-driven monitors are projected in App.xaml.cs, not added to fixedMonitors.
